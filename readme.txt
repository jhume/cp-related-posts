CP Related Posts is a plugin that displays related articles on your website, manually, or by the terms in the content, title or abstract, including the tags assigned to the articles.

== Description ==

CP Related Posts is a plugin that displays related articles on your website, manually, or by the terms in the content, title or abstract, including the tags assigned to the articles.

The relationship between posts and pages is determined in a very unique way.  CP Related Posts uses an algorithm that allows you to identify the most representative terms in the content, the title and the abstract of the article, while giving more weight to those terms that match the tags explicitly added to the articles by the author.

In any website, there may be posts that are related, yet with no common terms.  CP Related Posts allows to assign connections to articles manually, attributing the highest level of importance to that type of connection.

CP Related Posts offers a great versatility in displaying related posts. With CP Related Posts, you can define the number of related posts, use a specific layout to display related articles. Similarly, it is possible to decide which information to display for the related post: title, author, tags by which they relate, and importantly, an image that identifies the percentage of correspondence between the two posts.
